# CS-499-Capstone-Project

This repo is my Capstone Project for my CS-499: Computer Science Capstone class at Southern New Hampsire University.

In this project, I plan to take existing code developed previously in my CS-360: Mobile Application Development class and rewrite it in Swift and SwiftUI for iOS and improve upon it in the following three categories:

1. Software Engineering and Design
2. Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Databases
